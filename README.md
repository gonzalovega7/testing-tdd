This repository was created with the intention of practicing:
--> unit test and integration test


We have different branches, both for front, for back end and for back with ESModules.
To change branches:

```bash
  git switch "name of the branch"
  Example: git switch basic-testing-frontend
```

Now, we need to install dependencies
```bash
  npm install
```
